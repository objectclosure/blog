Wake up!

![](3am.jpg)

I don't recall much of my life in campus, yet I did my final exams just two months ago. No reference diary, probably because I didn't stick to electronic journaling in those 4 years. As far as I can tell, I was just winging it, doing life as it came.

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/){target="_blank"} has been a game changer for me. It's taken care of the journaling part, as well as planning. Generally, I'd say my productivity has improved a bit in the past couple of weeks.

Honestly speaking, I still feel like I'm winging it, directionless. Just letting life take me wherever it will. 

So I've decided to set clear goals for myself. 

The sacrifice? Ideally, sleep at 8pm, wake up at 3am. For the next 3 months. On top of that, I'm gonna be honest... I don't like masturbation. I don't even know why I do it. For the next 3 months, no pornography nor masturbation. Sex is welcome though.
